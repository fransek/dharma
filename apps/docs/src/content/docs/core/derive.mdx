title: derive
description: derive API reference.
---

Creates a derived store from an existing store.

A derived store computes its state based on the original store's state using a derive function.
The derived store's value is memoized and only recomputed when requested.

```ts
const derivedStore = derive(store, deriveFn, dependencyFn?);
```

## Parameters

- `store` - The original store to derive from
- `deriveFn` - A function that computes the derived state from the original state
- `dependencyFn` - Optional function that returns an array of dependencies. If provided, the derived state will only be recomputed when these dependencies change

## Returns

A new store containing the derived state. This store is read-only (no actions).

## Usage

```ts
import { derive } from "dharma-core";
import { counterStore } from "./counterStore";

export const doubleCounterStore = derive(
  counterStore,
  (state) => state.count * 2,
  (state) => [state.count],
);
```
